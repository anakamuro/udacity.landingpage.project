# README

 - I installed all project dependencies with npm install and started the dependencies with npm start.
 + This is a basic landing page that uses Javascript to create a NavBar dynamically and to highlight sections when scrolled. 
 + You will need to convert this project to an interactive one. 
 + This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file. 
 + "to top" button will go to the top. The pages will be moved by a smooth scroll, not by a jump. If you scroll, the navbar will be hided.
